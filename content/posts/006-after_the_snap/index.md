A month has passed since my last post and we have conveniently slipped into 2023. With the New Year New Me approaching, I can make a fresh start with some reservations. I think it's bullshit, but I'm in better mental shape to change things.

## blogging :newspaper:

I came across an [article on The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging) that nudged me in the direction of continuing this blog. I don't agree 100% with everything the author says, but it resonates with me. I'm very far away from all the Twitter craziness that's going on right now, so I'm not looking for shelter. However, I'm carving out my space on the web that can be my creation.

## self-care :pill:

As I mentioned in my previous post, I'm feeling a bit stuck. I think things are changing for the better as my employer gave me positive feedback. We even talked about an opportunity to move forward professionally. So there is a way forward.

I'm a devoted user of YNAB, but lately I've been using it more as an expense tracker than a budgeting tool. That also means I'm not aware of my finances. So the projects on that front are to replace YNAB with a self-hosted solution, use the Interactive Brokers account I have to accumulate some savings, consider the retirement incentive offered by my employer, and set budgeting goals to keep myself in check. I think this can be accomplished in the 1st quarter.

Reading has been a big part of my daily routine. I neglected it for the last two years. Around Q4 2022, I picked up my Kindle again and started reading every morning before work. This helped me go through my backlog of saved articles. I want to read more, so I have to take time out from other activities.

That activity will be using social media, as it is less fun than ever. Also, the invasion of privacy that all the major platforms are doing is very off-putting. I was an avid user of Facebook and Instagram, but I have become increasingly skeptical of them. To maintain my sanity, I explicitly stay away from the TikToks and BeReals of the world. I also started to follow privacy advocates, and some of their arguments really turned me. Maybe this topic deserves its own post.

For the past decade, I have been very focused on being physically fit. The changes I made to my diet towards the end of 2022 started to bring me into the shape I was looking for. However, I still need to improve on several fronts. I need to seek professional help, which will take some courage.

All of the above means that this year will be about clearing things out, strengthening the foundation, focusing on things that matter, and embracing change that can make me better. What I have now feels like an acceptable start, but there is always room for improvement.

## technical stuff :wrench:

It turns out that I enjoy tinkering with the framework of the blog more than actually writing posts. I canceled my web hosting contract when I realized I could host this site on GitHub Pages. After making minor tweaks to the posts, I finally gave up on the *Vox Scurra* moniker. It feels better to post all this under my name than under a pseudonym.

All that remains is to secure a domain in my name and continue the lost art of blogging.
