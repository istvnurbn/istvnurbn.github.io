In the past -- about 20 years ago -- I had a personal website hosted on UltraWEB's free service. It was a place where I  could tinker with things I learned in computer science class and express my thoughts in an unrestricted, yet structured way.

I decided to start something like a blog again with the following goals:

- improve my written English while articulating my thoughts,
- keep a log of the things I do,
- provide useful information for like-minded people

Since I'm still a very curious person, the content will cover a wide variety of topics that interest me. Do not expect consistency.

See you around!
