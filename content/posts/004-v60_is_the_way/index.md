It's been more than a month since I wrote about keeping an offline log of the coffees I try, and maybe posting some of them on this blog. Good news, the first one is here!

## meeting the parents :people_holding_hands:

On our recent trip to Slovenia, we happened to visit [Stow Coffee](https://stow.si) in Ljubljana. It was a great decision because they had *Coffea eugenioides* on their filter menu. The price was steep at €20, but I let the barista talk me intoto trying it.

So what is so special about it?

- Along with *Coffea canephora*, it is the parent of the beloved *Coffea arabica*.
- It is considered by some to be an endangered species.
- It is naturally sweet and has a unique set of flavor characteristics.

It was unassuming at first, but had some raw grain/hay notes. The taste was light and reminiscent of oatmeal with a slight sweetness. The finish was the bomb as the fruity flavors began to dominate and linger. That last part -- the lingering flavor -- was what got me, which is the measure of quality.

I discussed this experience with the owner of Szeged's iconic Kék Elefánt café, who noted that the hay note could be either a varietal thing or a sign of lighter-than-ideal roasting. If you get the chance, try it, but don't expect an earth-shattering experience.

## the proper method :scientist:

Speaking of the café in Szeged, I had a delicious cup of Peruvian coffee there. I had to ask them how they prepared their filter drinks and what kind of coffee they used. After buying a bag of beans, I decided to get my V60 out of the back of my closet. It is more involved to use than the Aeropress if you are like me and follow James Hoffman's Ultimate Guide.

At first, I was not getting the same flavor profile as I did in the coffee shop. This puzzled me, so I overcame my laziness and started adjusting the grind size on my Porlex. After 3-4 tries, I got what I wanted. I also tested it with different coffees that were available at home, and I have to say I've cracked it for myself.

These two episodes made me realize a few things. You have to push yourself to experiment with different methods and dare to set the grinder finer/coarser in larger increments. Fiddling with the V60 reconnected me with the process of making coffee, so I decided to put the Aeropress in the travel kit for now.
